# Apple has put a bullet in JS extensions, so this project is dead.

Github user [@Sh1d0w](https://github.com/Sh1d0w/) has created an alternative to this project using Safari App Extensions.  I haven't tried it yet, but you can find it over here: 

https://github.com/Sh1d0w/clean-links

# Classic README Contents:

Safari extension that strips tracking tokens from the following services:

* Google Analytics (i.e. Urchin Traffic Monitor)
* Youtube
* Mailchimp

The Google Analytics query string parameters are documented [here](http://www.google.com/support/analytics/bin/answer.py?answer=55578)

Based on the [work](https://github.com/jparise/chrome-utm-stripper) of Jon Parise as well as the [work](https://github.com/mihaip/utm-stripper) of Mihai Parparita
